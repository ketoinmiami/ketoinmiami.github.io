# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to the introductory post on Keto in Miami website! My wife and I have recently moved from the Dallas area over to Broward county. While enjoying the fantastic weather (outside of hurricane season!), we have found it much more difficult to adapt to the Keto lifestle since moving.

The purpose of this site is to share our Keto experiences with everyone so that people that are interested in Keto can find some helpful tips to start out, and those that are already enjoying the Keto lifestyle can find relevant information about restaurants, groceries, and recipies in the Miami area.

Everything is a work in progress, and we're open to suggestions [if you drop us a line](mailto:ketoinmiami@protonmail.com).
