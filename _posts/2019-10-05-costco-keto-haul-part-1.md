Who doesn't love Costco? Since doing Keto, Costco has been a part of our grocery regimen for getting meats (especially bacon!), cheeses, almond flour, and coffee.

I've noticed recently that Costco has gradually become more and more Keto friendly. Today I wanted to cover a few other items that you may not be aware of that may be at your local Costco. The items here I found at the [Pembroke Pines Costco](https://www.costco.com/warehouse-locations/pembroke-pines-fl-742.html).

## Land O Lakes Heavy Whipping Cream

Price: $3.99
Serving Size 1 Tbps 15mL
Amount Per Serving
Calories 50
Fat 5g
Carbs <1g
Ingredients: Heavy Cream, Skim Milk, 1% or less of: Mono and Diglycerides, Polysorbate 80, Carrageenan.

This is a staple in many Keto recipies and in our cups of coffee. We usually alternate between picking up heavy whipping cream at Costco or the local grocery store depending on the price.

## Blackberries

Price: $3.99

One of the lowest carb fruits that you can find, typically it's easier to find this in stock and at a lower price than your local Publix.


## Keto Snack Mix
Price: $12.89

Although it's easy enough to make your own Keto friendly trail mix, something's to be said for having a giant convenient snacking bag.

## Dark Chocolate Nuggets - Coconut + Super Seeds
Price:

This is soo good that the Mrs. told me to get rid of it in the house. Although it's not labeled for Keto specifically, net carbs only runs XX. Great for a treat, terrible when you're hungry!

## Lankanto Monkfuit Sweetner
Price:

Although MOnkfruit is prominently written on the label, looking at the ingredients list shows that this mostly Erythritol with some Monkfruit instead of the other way around. Nevertheless, this is a good alternative to having liquid stevia. Will probably do a more in-depth review on this later.


## Busseto California Snackin'

Price:
### Salami
Serving Size 1oz / 1.5 servings per container
Amount Per Serving
Calories 100

Prepackage meat and cheese snacks! What's not to love? These comes in packs of 8, with an entire package only running you about 300 calories, 22.5g of fat, and maybe 1g of carbs.

Everything is a work in progress, and we're open to suggestions [if you drop us a line](mailto:ketoinmiami@protonmail.com).
