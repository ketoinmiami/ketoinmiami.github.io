Who doesn't love Costco? Since doing Keto, Costco has been a part of our grocery regimen for getting meats (especially bacon!), cheeses, and coffee.

I've noticed recently that Costco has gradually become more and more Keto friendly. Today I wanted to cover a few other items that you may not be aware of that may be at your local Costco. The items here I found at the [Pembroke Pines Costco](https://www.costco.com/warehouse-locations/pembroke-pines-fl-742.html).

Everything is a work in progress, and we're open to suggestions [if you drop us a line](mailto:ketoinmiami@protonmail.com).
