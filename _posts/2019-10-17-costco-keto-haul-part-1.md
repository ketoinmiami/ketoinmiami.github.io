Who doesn't love Costco? Since doing Keto, Costco has been a part of our grocery regimen for getting meats (especially bacon!), cheeses, almond flour, and coffee.

I've noticed recently that Costco has gradually become more and more Keto friendly. Today I wanted to cover a few other items that you may not be aware of that may be at your local Costco. The items here I found at the [Pembroke Pines Costco](https://www.costco.com/warehouse-locations/pembroke-pines-fl-742.html).

Without further ado, here's some keto friendly items we've picked up.

## Land O Lakes Heavy Whipping Cream

![Heavy Whipping Cream](/img/heavy-whipping-cream.jpg "Heavy Whipping Cream")

Price: $3.99

Serving Size 1 Tbps / 15mL

Amount Per Serving | 
--- | ---:
Calories | 50
Fat | 5g
Carbs | <1g
Ingredients | Heavy Cream, Skim Milk, 1% or less of: Mono and Diglycerides, Polysorbate 80, Carrageenan.

This is a staple in many Keto recipies and in our cups of coffee. We usually alternate between picking up heavy whipping cream at Costco or the local grocery store depending on the price.

## Blackberries

Price: $3.99

One of the lowest carb fruits that you can find, typically it's easier to find this in stock and at a lower price than your local Publix.


## Keto Snack Mix

![Keto Snack Mix](/img/keto-snack-mix.jpg)

Price: $12.89

Serving Size 1 oz / 24 servings per container

Amount Per Serving | 
--- | ---:
Calories | 170
Fat | 15g
Net Carbs | 2g
Protein | 7g
Ingredients | Almonds, Pepitas, Dried Cheddar Cheese, Pecans, Macadamia Nuts, Sunflower Seeds...

Although it's easy enough to make your own Keto friendly trail mix, something's to be said for having a giant convenient snacking bag.

## Dark Chocolate Nuggets - Coconut + Super Seeds

![Chocolate Nuggets](/img/chocolate-nuggets.jpg "Dark Chocolate Nuggets with Coconut")

Price: $10.69

Serving Size 1/3 cup / 28 servings per container

Amount Per Serving | 
--- | ---:
Calories | 100
Fat | 8g
Net Carbs | 4g
Protein | 2g
Ingredients | Organic Dark Chocolate, Organic Coconut, Organic Pumpkin Seeds, Organic Sunflower Seeds, Organic Coconut Flour, Organice Cane Sugar, Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Organic Chia Seeds, Sea Salt.

This is soo good that the Mrs. told me to get rid of it in the house. Although it's not labeled for Keto specifically, net carbs only runs 4g per serving. Great for a treat, terrible when you're hungry!

## Lankanto Monkfruit Sweetner

![Monkfruit Sweetner](/img/monkfruit-sweetner.jpg "Monkfruit Sweetner")

Price: $8.99

Serving Size 1 teaspoon / 200 servings per container

Amount Per Serving |
--- | ---:
Calories | 0
Fat | 0g
Net Carbs | 0g
Protein | 0g
Ingredients | Erythritol, Monk Fruit Extract

Although Monkfruit is prominently written on the label, looking at the ingredients list shows that this more Erythritol with some Monkfruit instead of the other way around. Nevertheless, this is a good alternative to having liquid stevia. Will probably do a more in-depth review on this later.


## Busseto California Snackin'
